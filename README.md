# Football Fantasy Simulation

A project that I worked on with my Icelandic schoolmates Jósúa Theodórsson, Þorgeir Sigurðsson and Þorkell Máni Þorkelsson. The class was called "Development of Software". The project was about creating a Football Fantasy simulation program. In Football Fantasy, players compete in such a fashion where they select existing football players for their dream team. Teams then compete and the players receive points based on how well their selected football players performed in the league. We used historical statistics to create empirical distributions that determined how many goals, red cards, yellow cards and so on a football player received. 

Here is a presentation we held for our schoolmates as a final assignment in the course: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32876027/ekki_eyda/Fantasy%20premier%20league.pdf

A report we wrote explaning in depth how we created the simulation istelf (includes R and PHP sourcecode):
